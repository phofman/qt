Repository of Qt 4.8+ binaries for PlayBook 2.1.x
===

This repository is simply a dummy placeholder for NuGet-package definitions that inject Qt libraries into dedicated native projects.

To use them in creation of real applications it's first recommended to install [BlackBerry NDK plugin for Visual Studio](https://github.com/phofman/vs-plugin) via [Visual Studio plugin Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?query=blackberry%20qnx&f%5B0%5D.Value=blackberry%20qnx&f%5B0%5D.Type=SearchText&ac=4). It's also an open-source project.

Qt v4.8+ build recipes for PlayBook and BB10 devices can be found on [wiki pages](https://github.com/phofman/qt/wiki).
